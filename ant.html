    <p>Howdy! My name is Anthony Nguyen, I am a Senior Technology Management Major at Texas A&M University</p>
    <div style="width:50%;margin:auto">I am twenty-one years old and have five other siblings in my family. I am the fourth child; I have three older siblings and two younger siblings. I was born and raised in a city on the outskirts of Houston, Texas called Richmond, Texas. 
        Attending Texas A&M University for the past three to four years has given me the opportunity to meet lifelong friends and have unforgettable experiences. One thing that I love to do is attend the football games in the fall. My favorite game that I went to was last year’s game against Alabama. This game was so thrilling and exiting the whole way through, and we were able to win the game against the number one team in the nation. 
        Once I graduate in the Spring of 2023, I will miss College Station very much. But I cannot wait to see what my future has in store for me and what great experiences I will get to experience next!
