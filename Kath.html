    <p>My name is Katherine Guerra-Gutierrez.
        I was born in McAllen Texas and moved to Houston Texas during my middle school years where I currently reside when I'm not on campus. I graduated in 2019 from Cleveland High School, a relatively small town about an hour away from Houston with a class of around 250.
        I am passionate about cyber security and online privacy. In my free time, I am an amateur writer. I like to spend my time binge-watching horror movies and hanging out with my friends whenever we all have the time. I am the youngest in my family! I have two older brothers and two older sisters all of which are married and have kids already. I have a pretty big family on both my mother's side and my dad's side so things get hectic when everyone has vacation days. 
        A reason I choose to attend Texas A&M was that I thought it would be cool to walk around a campus like it for four years straight! Thereâ€™s also the academics which I was told were pretty good too. My major, technology management, originally caught my eye because of its built-in business minor but now that I'm close to graduating I don't really care much for the business classes and find myself enjoying my technology classes more and more. I've stuck it out this long though and I might as well finish the little number of classes I have for my minor.
        A big part of my life has been the handful of friends that I've sustained over the years. I can't say who I would have become without them. I think that they've had as much of an impact on me as I've had on them. We all surprisingly chose the IT field to work in so we like to bounce off ideas and help each other out however we can. So here's a fun little picture of little kid me and my good friend Vanessa who's been with me through it all!
